# AstroDynamics: 
This repository contains numerical methods for solving Magnetohydrodynamics and the dynamics of gravitating systems, including Celestial, Stellar and Fluid Mechanics.

Modules are written in Python with available implementations in Julia, Fortran90 and C++.

# Installation
To load the the scripts as general modules, clone the repository and do a local pip install:

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Professor-G/AstroDynamics.git
    $ cd AstroDynamics
    $ pip install .
```

The program or the modules can then be imported directly:

```python
import AstroDynamics
```

```python
from AstroDynamics import orbits
```
